# Snowpack, TS, React starter

> âœ¨ Bootstrapped with Create Snowpack App (CSA).

## Notes

This is a starter. It would be ideal to get JSS or styled components working in Snowpack as well and will save that for another chapter.
For the time being, using `.css` files, but prefer otherwise.

The larger hassles in this initial setup are the ts/eslint configurations. These may require more tweaking depending on your usage.

## Available Scripts

### npm start

Runs the app in the development mode.
Open http://localhost:8080 to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### npm run build

Builds a static copy of your site to the `build/` folder.
Your app is ready to be deployed!

**For the best production performance:** Add a build bundler plugin like "@snowpack/plugin-webpack" to your `snowpack.config.js` config file.

### npm test

Launches the application test runner.
Run with the `--watch` flag (`npm test -- --watch`) to run in interactive watch mode.
